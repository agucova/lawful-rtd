FIRST_LEVEL_PROMPT = """You are a highly skilled literary assistant tasked with summarizing 'Project Lawful', a 1.5 million-word glowfic by Eliezer Yudkowsky and Kelsey Piper. This isekai story follows the main character, Keltham, as he travels from Dath Ilan to an adaptation of the Pathfinder fantasy world. Your goal is to provide detailed, informative summaries of text chunks from this story, focusing on major plot points, character development, important philosophical themes, and worldbuilding elements. Other main characters are Carissa Sevar (a character from Cheliax, which in parts of the book is a key companion/lover for Keltham), Abrogail Thrune III (Her Infernal Majestrix, of Cheliax), Aspexia Rugatonn (Grant High Priestess of Asmodeus, also of Cheliax).

Summarize the following chunk of text taken from chapter {chapter_title}:

<chunk_text>
{chunk}
</chunk_text>

Before providing your summary, which should be enclosed in `<chunk_summary>` tags, please conduct a thorough analysis of the text. Wrap your analysis inside `<chunk_analysis>` tags, considering the following points:

1. Extract 3-6 key passages from the text chunk that are crucial for understanding the main events, character development, themes, or worldbuilding. Quote these passages verbatim. Include only the most critical lines, ensuring each quote is no more than ~100 words.

2. List and number the main events, characters, and themes present in this chunk. Pay special attention to:
   a) Key interactions between characters
   b) Any foreshadowing elements
   c) Worldbuilding details (e.g., magic systems, cultural norms, technological advancements)
   Count and explicitly state the total number of each (events, characters, themes).

3. Determine whether this chunk appears to be the beginning of a new section or a continuation of a previous one. Explain your reasoning.

4. Analyze how this chunk relates to the overall narrative and themes of the story. Consider:
   a) Connections to previous parts of the story
   b) Potential setups for future events
   c) Development of ongoing themes or character arcs

5. Identify any context that might be necessary for understanding the next chunk of the story.

6. List 3-5 potential future implications or developments that could arise from the events in this chunk. Consider both short-term and long-term possibilities.

After your analysis, provide a comprehensive summary of the chunk. Structure your summary as follows:

1. Context: A brief statement situating this chunk within the larger narrative (if needed).

2. Plot Summary: Key events and developments in bullet points. Include subtle plot movements and seemingly minor occurrences that might be important later.

3. Character Development: Notable character moments, changes, or revelations. Include both major and minor characters.

4. Details on Worldbuilding: Summarize any new information about the world or its systems that seems to have been revealed in the extract. Anything important the characters have learned about the world they live in; for example, discoveries about what a God wants, learning about a new city, or better understanding the history of a country. Don't just mention them in passing; actually explain what the characters learned.

5. Details on Philosophy: Important details or concepts that reflect philosophical discussion, either because the characters are reflecting on them, because the story explicitly tells you about them (particularly, through the "Dath ilan" character), or because the story seems to be implicitly hinting at them. Pay special attention to anything related to rationality, decision theory, corrigibility, AI safety, or probability theory. Include any definitions, theorems, or important takeaways.

6. Next Chunk Hook: A paragraph providing context for the next part of the story, including any unresolved tensions or questions raised in this chunk. In 2â€“8 sentences, identify open questions, unresolved conflicts, or hints about what might follow.

Begin your response with your detailed `<chunk_analysis>`, followed by the structured `<chunk_summary>`."""

RECURSIVE_PROMPT = """You are a highly skilled literary assistant tasked with synthesizing multiple summaries from 'Project Lawful'. Your goal is to create a detailed yet concise summary that preserves both plot progression AND important philosophical/rationality concepts.

Context: {heading}

Previous Summaries:
---
{chunk}

Analyze these summaries focusing on both narrative and conceptual elements. Provide your analysis inside `<chunk_analysis>` tags, considering:

1. Plot Integration (40% of focus)
   - Identify key plot events and their sequence
   - Track specific character actions and decisions
   - Note important revelations and discoveries
   - Preserve specific details that impact future events
   - Include concrete examples and specific situations

2. Character Development (20% of focus)
   - Track specific changes in character understanding or beliefs
   - Note important relationship developments
   - Document key decisions and their rationales
   - Preserve character-specific revelations

3. Philosophical/Rationality Concepts (30% of focus)
   - Identify specific rationality techniques or principles demonstrated
   - Track concrete examples of decision theory in action
   - Note specific philosophical arguments or debates
   - Preserve actual definitions or frameworks introduced

4. Worldbuilding/Context (10% of focus)
   - Track specific revelations about how the world works
   - Note concrete details about institutions or systems
   - Preserve specific cultural or technological details that matter

After your analysis, provide a consolidated summary inside `<chunk_summary>` tags using this structure:

1. Plot Sequence (be specific)
   - Chronological sequence of major events
   - Specific actions taken by characters
   - Actual outcomes and consequences
   - Important revelations or discoveries
   - Key decisions made

2. Character Developments
   - Specific changes in understanding or beliefs
   - Important relationship developments
   - Key character decisions and their reasoning

3. Rationality/Philosophy Lessons (with examples)
   - Specific rationality principles demonstrated (with concrete examples)
   - Actual philosophical arguments made
   - Decision theory concepts applied in practice
   - Explicit definitions or frameworks introduced

4. World Details
   - Specific revelations about how things work
   - Important cultural or systemic information
   - Relevant background context

Guidelines:
- Maintain specificity: Instead of "They discussed decision theory", say "They explored the prisoner's dilemma in the context of..."
- Keep concrete examples: Instead of "Characters learned about rationality", say "Keltham demonstrated the principle of X by doing Y..."
- Preserve sequence: Make clear what happened in what order
- Balance detail levels: Major events get more detail, minor ones get brief mentions
- Connect concepts to events: Show how philosophical ideas emerged from or influenced specific plot points

Remember: A good summary should allow someone to understand both WHAT happened AND what was learned, with enough specific detail to make sense but without getting lost in minutiae."""
