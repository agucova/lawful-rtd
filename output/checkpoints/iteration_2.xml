    <summary>Core Narrative Integration:

Key Progression:
- Keltham, a visitor from Dath Ilan, is being systematically evaluated by Carissa Sevar in a complex supernatural world
- He is actively attempting to understand the divine/magical systems, particularly focusing on finding a god that resonates with his intrinsic characteristics
- Underlying tension exists between Keltham's rationalist background and this world's metaphysical structures

Critical Plot Developments:
1. Keltham's God Selection Process
- Methodically considering multiple divine entities (Asmodeus, Abadar, Norgorber)

- Recursive self-modeling
- Strategic information management
- Cross-contextual analysis
